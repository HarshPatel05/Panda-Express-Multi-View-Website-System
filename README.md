### **Important Note About Database Access:**

- The database used in this project may no longer be accessible.
- You can view the frontend without needing the database. Some features (like placing orders or managing the menu) may not work due to the lack of a live backend connection.
- The frontend will still display the menu, Register, Kiosk, and Manager views, but interaction with the database (e.g., placing orders or updating data) may not function unless the database is reconnected.
